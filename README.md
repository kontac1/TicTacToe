# TicTacToe
The game is for two players. One player places the X pieces and the other player places the O pieces. 

In Java, using a class, a multidimensional array, and appropriate-designed methods and functions, I write a program that will allow two users to play Tic-Tac-Toe as many times as desired. The game board allow users to place pieces (X or O) by taking turns. 


#chalenges: it was challenging to take into consideration every scenario that may crash the game or violate the game rules. 

#leasson learned: Asking question and conducting code review with peers allow me to make my program more robust. Additionally, multidimentional array are very useful to write that require inserting element at a specific position.
